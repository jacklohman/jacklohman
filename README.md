# How's it going, I'm Jack

I'm a recent graduate with a focus in Data Analytics and Psychology, a problem solver who enjoys turning messy data into a variety of projects. I'm passionate about subjects related to sports, behavior, media, and just about everything in between.

## My tool of choice is R, but I also know and love:
Python, Java, SQL, SPSS, working with APIs (JSON and JSON Lines), and AWS.

Thanks for stopping by!
